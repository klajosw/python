His mother was a gifted singer, of Italian descent, and his father was a wine merchant and Jewish. Adorno’s partial Jewish status was to have an immeasurable effect upon his life and philosophical works. He was an academically and musically gifted child. Initially, it appeared that Adorno was destined for a musical career. During the early to mid 1920s Adorno studied music composition under Alban Berg in Vienna and his talent was recognized by the likes of Berg and Schoenberg. However, in the late 1920s, Adorno joined the faculty of the University of Frankfurt and devoted the greatest part of his considerable talent and energy to the study and teaching of philosophy. Adorno’s Jewish heritage forced him to eventually seek exile from Nazi Germany, initially registering as a doctoral student at Merton College, Oxford and then, as a member of the University of Frankfurtís Institute for Social Research, in New York concluding his exile in Southern California. Adorno did not complete his Oxford doctorate and appeared to be persistently unhappy in his exilic condition. Along with other members of the Institute for Social Research, Adorno returned to the University of Frankfurt immediately after the completion of the war, taking up a professorial chair in philosophy and sociology. Adorno remained a professor at the University of Frankfurt until his death in 1969. He was married to Gretel and they had no children.",,

He earned School Music Diplomas I and 11 at the Academy for School and Church Music in Lucerne, and also attended the Jazz School in Berne. Ammann spent 1986 as a freelance musician in Berlin, taking part above all in projects involving improvised music. From 1988 to 1992 he studied theory and composition at the Basel Music Academy (Roland Moser, Detlev Muller- Siemens among others) and attended courses with Witold Lutoslawski, Dieter Schnebel, Niccolo Castiglioni and Wolfgang Rihm. Having already participated in numerous projects in the fields of jazz, rock and improvised music as a trumpeter, pianist, bass player, arranger and composer, Dieter Ammann took up composing at the age of twenty-eight. As it assumed an increasingly central role in his multifarious musical activities, he began liberating himself from serial techniques in individual works (,,Developments"" for two trumpets, horn, trombone, tuba 1993) and subsequently arrived at a freer, more intuitive approach. Ammann has received several encouragement prizes and grants. He has also won international awards: top prize at the International Competition for Composers (in honor of Luciano Berio) of the IBLA Foundation New York; first prize at the Symposium NRW für Neue Musik; Young Composers in Europa Leipzig (first prize); and the Franz Liszt Grant of the Weimar 1999 Kulturstadt Europas GmbH, in cooperation with the academy of music.",,

466,Pedro,António Avondano,,,"Lisbon,Portugal","Lisbon,Portugal","Much of the documentation relating to the early years of the career of Pedro António Avondano was lost in the great 1755 Lisbon earthquake, but by the beginning of the 1760s, he was known to have been one of the most influential musicians in Lisbon. According to José Mazza, a late eighteenth-century biographer who compiled a Dictionary of Portuguese Musicians a few years after Pedro António’s death, states that the latter, “was a violinist in the Royal Chamber and an excellent composer. His music had great harmony and much softness”. Today, Avondano’s keyboard music survives mostly in manuscripts belonging to the National Libraries of Paris and Lisbon, but new sources are still quite likely to appear whenever the existant Portuguese keyboard repertoire of the second half of the eighteenth century is thoroughly surveyed. The works can be seen as typical of a post-Baroque taste, mostly close to the Rococo and the Style Galant trends of European instrumental music in the 1750s and 60s. There are, however, suggestions of an expressive, somewhat “pre-Romantic” mood that nowadays we tend to associate exclusively with the German Empfindsamkeit composers such as Carl Philip Emmanuel Bach, for instance, but which was in fact quite characteristic also for the mid-eighteenth-century Neapolitan Opera, a genre quite familiar to Portuguese composers of the period.",,

There, he acquired a wide range of knowledge, learned several languages, absorbed the essentials of Humanism and Renaissance, and last but not least, was instructed in the art of musical composition. He stay at Innsbruck gave the young nobleman an orientation which determined his subsequent lifepath. Apart from that influence, though, Harant was doubtless endowed with natural talent for a good many areas of activity, his creative and restless spirit driving him ever to the forefront of his contemporaries. Active as a man of letters, artist and musician, he was an equally accomplished explorer, sportsman, hunter and soldier. Perhaps the only thing Harant lacked was property. That was apparently also the cause of his modest official career, a sphere where he actually received his due only at the dramatic time of the Estates revolt, with tragic effect.

Balakauskas in his early conservatory years has been influenced by Stockhausen, Boulez, Xenakis and in particular, Webern and Messiaen. However, in the 1960’s, he developed his own harmonic system, which carries a strong sense of tonality, termed the “Balakauskas tonality”. This is radically different from the atonality and serialism of the Second Viennese School. His harmonic system employs specific subsets of notes from the twelve, and the frequent simultaneous use of the minor and major third lends his music a jazzy feeling, although the composer has clarified such being a coincidence.",,

He studied briefly in Rome and soon thereafter was appointed Vice-Kapellmeisterat Dresden in 1655. Possibly resentful over the favoring of Italian Musicians at the Saxon court, Bernhard procured in 1663 a post as Kantor at St. John’s School in Hamburg. In 1670 Schütz commissioned him to compose a funeral piece for him, which was performed at the elder composer’s funeral two years later. Though highly regarded by his contemporaries as a composer, principally of sacred vocal works in both German and Latin, Bernhard is remembered today chiefly for his theoretical treatises, especially for the Tractatus compositionis augmentatus,widely circulated in manuscript during the second half of the 17th century. In it he divided music into three categories: the stylus gravis, the classical polyphony of Palestrina and others; the stylus luxurians communis,the style initiated by Monteverdi; and the stylus luxurians theatralis,or recitative style.",,

His first major work as a composer was The Sinking of the Titanic, for indeterminate forces. His international reputation was confirmed with the opera, Medea, which was produced at the Opéra de Lyon and the Paris Opéra in 1984. A reworking of his cult work, Jesus’ Blood Never Failed Me Yet, with vocal by Tom Waits, gained wide recognition in 1993. He has composed prolifically for theater, dance and film as well as the concert hall, and has had his works performed by a wide range of artists including the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Arditti Quartet, the Hilliard Ensemble, the Balanescu Quartet, Charlie Haden, Bill Frisell, and his own group, the Gavin Bryars Ensemble. A leading experimental composer, his more recent music has been influenced by theories of literature, and is often repetitive and witty.

There, he acquired a wide range of knowledge, learned several languages, absorbed the essentials of Humanism and Renaissance, and last but not least, was instructed in the art of musical composition. He stay at Innsbruck gave the young nobleman an orientation which determined his subsequent lifepath. Apart from that influence, though, Harant was doubtless endowed with natural talent for a good many areas of activity, his creative and restless spirit driving him ever to the forefront of his contemporaries. Active as a man of letters, artist and musician, he was an equally accomplished explorer, sportsman, hunter and soldier. Perhaps the only thing Harant lacked was property.

However, “Die Werelt hielt mi in hair gewout” (The World Held Me in Its Power), was reprinted with its melody intact in the Utrecht Liederbuch (ca. 1500) with the added comment: “these little songs have been done by Schwester Bertken, the recluse in Utrecht.” The “recluse in Utrecht” would seem to indicate that Bertken’s pious contemplative life and strict enclosure, if not her music, were well-known in Utrecht at the time.",,

His youth, family life and education are undocumented, but he probably was privately apprenticed, like many English contemporaries, in a wealthy household. Indeed the first evidence of his carreer is from 16 april 1603, when the household of sir Robert Cecil, Secretary of State to the crown, paid him £3 prior to a journey to the Low Countries, as later before other trips to the continent (notably Germany); in May 1608 he was himself paid for the teaching of a boy,  named George Mason. There is no concrete evidence for the theory that he visited Italy before 1604 and adopted the name Giovanni Coperario, which he would then have kept after returning home; the story nonetheless persists (in 1662 Thomas Fuller even wrote he was an Italian), and he may well have been there, quite possibly also studying; while troughout the Ancien Régime musicians travelling to foreign employ commonly “naturalized” their names, in England exoticism was such that it paid to do the inverse, especially Italianize, given the obvious.success of the Italian musical families Ferrabosco, Lupo and Bassano both at court and in major private (aristrocratic) households. Cooper served at the English court from 1605 to 1626 as lutenist, viol (= viola da gamba) player and composer, and taught the future Stuart King Charles I and also Henry Lawes (qv) and William Lawes (qv). In the service of Queen Anne from 1605, by 1608 he was also in the private service of Sir Robert Cecil, since 1605 created 1st Earl of Salisbury, since 1608 Lord High Treasurer. Through 1612 John tought Prince Henry Stuart (d. 1613). In 1616–17 he traveled in Europe. He became the favorite and directed a specially created group of musicians when in the service (since 1618) of Prince Charles Stuart, who once enthroned (Charles I) made him Composer in Ordinary (his first salaried court position; also Musician for Lute and Voices) from 1625 through his death in 1626.",,

His father, while recognizing his talent, strove to direct his efforts toward more practical endeavors like science, math, or even law.

As he grew older, he studied opera as a a lyric tenor and performed for several years.  In time, he moved from the realm of performance to composition.  In a mutually beneficial alliance, Kevin Cornelius has recently collaborated with playwright, Brad Allison to create a new musical, Consequences.  Consequences, completed in 2006, is an adaptation of Mr. Allison’s play of 1996 dealing withloss and deception involving three gay men and a woman.

He was prince of Venoza and felt as though he could get away with it, so he had his men run the Duke (dressed in the woman’s blouse) through with halbreds and shot with muskettes. He saved the pleasure of murdering his wife himself. Some contemporary accounts have him disemboweling her, some have her both disemboweled and slit at the throat (jack the ripper style); all accounts suggest that this was not the wife’s first tryst, and that her beauty was topped only by her lack of sexual morality and her ""mannish"" courage. Lay monks ravished her corpse because of her fetching good looks (really, no kidding). I wrote an opera on the subject back in the early 1990’s. It is the only one of my three operas that has not been performed in its entirety. Gesualdo’s music, highly progressive in terms of harmony, imagine Wagner or Hugo Wolf in Madrigal form, has often been connected to the composer’s dark side. He eventually went insane with guilt over his deed, and in particular was perpetually constipated because of latent then overt horror over how he killed his wife. The actual cause of death was blood poisoning due to this contant state of constipation. (Sorry to be so graphic but it is unavoidable in any discussion of this great but highly disturbed musician.)",,

He added a different dimension to his music life by successfully completing sound recording and tonmaistership education at TRT Ankara Radio. He represented Turkey in various festivals abroad, using the patterns of traditional Turkish music with a contemporary expression in the works he wrote for orchestral and chamber music. Gocmen, who wrote works of classical as well as newage, composed music for documentaries, festivals and ads. He has also works for Modern Dance, in which he modernized folk dances with a contemporary view and arrangement. We see the name Gocmen for the first time on the album called ""Miniatures from Kalan Music"". Following this was his solo album, ""Gocmen — The End"", which is composed of his own compositions. The album, production of which was undertaken by Dogan Music Company (DMC), is a synthesis of Gocmen’s works and, in his words: ""A Music of Anatolia"". He performed with his symphonic and ethnic orchestra in Ephesus Antique Theatre in International Izmir Music Festival in year 2002.

He stay at Innsbruck gave the young nobleman an orientation which determined his subsequent lifepath.

Active as a man of letters, artist and musician, he was an equally accomplished explorer, sportsman, hunter and soldier. Perhaps the only thing Harant lacked was property.

He taught composition in Shanghai and from 1949 to 1984 directed the Conservatory, with an interruption during the Cultural Revolution; he earned a reputation in China as a fervent promoter of Western classical music, seeing it as a means of modernizing Chinese music. A prominent Communist Party member, he was known for his numerous patriotic film scores and politically inspired songs and choral works, though he also produced operas and orchestral works. Much of his music consists of Western Romantic harmonizations of Chinese folk and folk-inspired melodies. His views brought him into serious conflict with anti-Western populists and provoked violent attacks on him and his family during the Cultural Revolution.",,

He moved into feature films in the late 1970s and early 1980s, scoring American Film Institute projects and movies for the notorious producer Roger Corman’s New World Pictures. His first big job was to be asked to score the second Star Trek movie, ‘The Wrath of Khan’, in 1982 and since then he has never looked back. His incredible rise to fame has never been equalled in Hollywood composing circles, and his contributions to the film world have included some of the best and most memorable scores of recent years, including ‘Krull’, ‘Brainstorm’, ‘Cocoon’, ‘Aliens’, ‘Willow’, ‘Glory’, ‘Field of Dreams’, ‘Legends of the Fall’, ‘Braveheart’ and ‘Apollo 13’. His most recent score, for James Cameron’s epic ‘Titanic’ was honoured with a Golden Globe, something he has never won before, although he did win a Grammy Award in 1986 for the Linda Ronstadt/James Ingram ballad ‘Somewhere Out There’, which he wrote for the film ‘An American Tail’. Horner’s future projects include the swashbuckler ‘The Mark of Zorro’ starring Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins, the comedy ‘Mighty Joe Young’ and the action thriller ‘Deep Impact’ for director Mimi Leder.

2329,Adolf,von Henselt,1814-05-09,,"Schwabach,Germany","Cieplice,Czech Republic","Adolf von Henselt was born in 1814 in Schwabach, a small village close to Nuremberg,as one of six children, and at the age of 3 moved to Munich where hehad his first piano lessons beeing five years old. At the age of fifteen he gave his first public recital, and in 1831 was granted a stipend to study piano with Hummel and composition in Vienna with Simon Sechter. Aristrocatic in looks and bearing, he would in later years resemble the Emperor Franz Josef. His early success touring in Germany and Russia was undelined by the reception of his sets of studies (op. 2 &amp; 5). They were dedicated to his royal patron and included the best (only?) known work of Henselt today - &quot;Si oiseau j’étai, à toi volerai&quot;, a tricky feather-light study in sixths once given the distinction of a recording by Rachmaninov. These Studies attracted a lot of attention for the young virtuoso, many of them presenting technical problems different from those in Chopin’s two sets (published previously) but still maintaining the new concept of exercises wraped in poetry.To the present day they remain beyond the capabilities of many pianists. Even the legendary Anton Rubinstein had to admit defeat. After working on the Etudes and the F minor Piano Concerto for a few days, he realised ""it was a waste of time, for they were based on an abnormal formation of the hand. In this respect, Henselt, like Paganini was a freak&quot;. There is a liberal use of chords of the tenth (sometimes twelth) and arpeggios with a larger strecht than an octave. It wasn’t that Henselt had large hands - au contraire, he is known to have small hands with short fleshy fingers. But by means of diligent self-consuming practice he managed to achieve an amazing degree of elasticity with an extension that could reach C-E-G-C-F in his left hand and B-E-A-C-E in the right!! All this augured well for an important career as a pianist and composer. Neither came about. Towards the end of his life Henselt himself recognised that he had not fullfilled his early promise. As a composer, he simply has nothing else to say after the age of thirty, recognised the fact and lived with it. From the completion of the F minor Concerto (1844) to his death, there is no advance in style or content in the few works. Given the paucity of creativity, the extent of his influence on piano playing is remarkable, for two reasons. First by way of the prodigious technical invention of the Études (and for that matter, the Concerto), resulted in fuller tone in bass and greatly increased coverage in the upper registers of the keyboard. This his to be seen in the later music of Balakirev, Lyapunov, Scriabin and Rachmaninov (who must have greatly benefied from his study of Henselt). The second influence Henselt had on the piano playing was a result of his position in the cultural life of Russia. His triumph as a visiting concert pianist in St. Petersburg in 1838 led immediately to him being named Court Pianist. From then until his death, Henselt spent all but the summer months each year in the Russian city where he enjoyed a princely lifestyle and was on intimate terms with three successive Tsars. And this does not take into acount tje influence of Henselt’s own private pupils. Among them were Rachmaninov’s grandfather and Nicolai Zverev. Zverev taught Rachmaninov himself, Lhevinne, Siloti ans Scriabin. Here we have the foundations of the present Russian school of piano-playing with its emphasis on singing melody and freedom of hand movement. Henselt’s contribution to the piano was at least as significant as that of Liszt and Leschetizky.",,

His instrument was the organ and he earned his living as an organist from the age of 22 until his death. He was from a poor family, son of a military musician in the province town of Naestved. Krygell was meant to be a craftsman, but illnes prevented him, and instead he learned to play the organ. In 1867 he was admitted to the new Conservatory of Copenhagen, where he spent 18 months. When he returned, he was appointed organist of the Herlufsholm boarding school. In 1880 he moved with his family (wife Ulrica and three girls) to Copenhagen and started as an organist in the newly opened Skt. Matthaeus: Church. He kept the job until his death. Krygell was a prolific composer with more than 150 works. The main body of his output are 24 string quartets, one in every key, as well as 3 symphonies and 10 orchestral ouvertures. He also wrote a lot of music for the organ, and this music was the most frequently performed in his own time. The most important work for organ is the 24 preludes and fuges. Krygell was never a big name in Danish musical life, first of all because his music with its blend of baroque writing and late romantic expressivity was too strange for danish music lovers, but also because Krygell himself apparently was quite a strange person. Coming from the province with no social contacts probably didn’t make things easier, and Krygell remained somewhat isolated from the main stream musical life in Copenhagen.",,

In 1982 Lanzani recorded a collection of songs, a Dream in the Middle of the Sea, a rock blues record played by the Lanzani Band, a rock band which never existed, produced by an imaginary recording company: Old Boot. In 1984 he created his second collection of poems, conceived as a white box: Parallel Roads. In April 85 he finished recording his second collection of songs, Vor Ihrem Geburtstag (Birthday’s Eve). Lanzani composed the music and Daniela De Meo wrote the lyrics. The name of the imaginary band was Parsifal. He published his third collection of poems Cosmic Love in 1986, a silver box which he presented on the occasion of his first multimedia exhibition in Venice, at the Scoleta of the Church of San Zaccaria in August of that year. The title of the exhibition of poems, music, photographs and drawings was No Roots. He wrote his most recent collection of poems in 1989: a gold box entitled The Saint and the Hero. In December 1996 Lanzani presented his first work of sacred music: an Ave Maria sung by the choir of Travo under the direction of Andrea Zermani in the church of Travo (Piacenza). A Pater Noster for a polyphonic choir and a Stabat Mater for voice and string orchestra were presented, in the church of S. Maria Ausiliatrice in Jesolo, at Easter, this year, along with the Latin version of the Ave Maria and Veni Creator Spititus for voice and organ.

After a series of teaching and administrative appointments at Chinese conservatories, he was appointed head of the Central Conservatory (1950). Persecuted at the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution (1966), he fled to the USA, where he remained until his death. Though initially better known as a violinist than a composer, Ma wrote patriotic songs for use during the 1930s and 40s. Most of his large-scale pieces date from the central phase of his career in China. He was particularly active as an organizer in later years, working to develop the infrastructure for the development of Western-style composition and performance in China. In exile in America, he resumed his earlier concentration on composition.",,

In the past his biggest inspirations was that of Paul Hindemith and Bela Bartók, but now he began to go in the direction of Pierre Boulez and Olivier Messiaen. Especially the latter turned him around to be a true follower of this composers style. He also got another direction of influence, namely Indonesian music and aboriginal music. From 1961 to 1968 he was lector of Music on Elder Cons. of music, and from 1969 to 1988 on Adelaide University.",,

In 1958, he co-founded (with Robert Ashley) Ann Arbor’s Cooperative Studio for Electronic Music; later, he helped to invent a new theatrical art based in part on projected images which eventually came to be known as ""Space Theatre."" Mumma began his musical life with private studies on horn, piano, and composition. From 1952-3, he attended the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Mumma attended the Institute of Science and Technology at the University from 1959-62, and served there as a research associate (in acoustics and seismics) from 1962-3. He maintained an involvement with the Cooperative Studio and, from 1960-6, directed the ONCE Festival of Contemporary Music. Mumma moved to New York in 1966. From 1966-74 he was -- with John Cage and David Tudor -- one of three composer-musicians to regularly collaborate with choreographer Merce Cunningham. Also from 1966, he performed with the Sonic Arts Union, whose members also included Tudor, Ashley, David Behrman, and Alvin Lucier. Mumma’s career in academia has found him on the faculties of several major universities in the U.S. and abroad, including the famed Ferienkurse für Neue Musik in Darmstadt, Germany. From 1975-94, he was on the faculty of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Over the years Mumma has composed for acoustic instruments in various configurations (mostly solo piano and chamber ensembles), and for electronic and computer resources. In addition to his activities within the mainstream of new music, he’s also worked with such varied artists as free jazz composer Anthony Braxton, electric guitarist Fred Frith, conceptual artist Marcel Duchamp, and painter Jasper Johns. Mumma has also toured widely and written extensively on music and technology.",,

Parry’s most significant works are probably his symphonies, especially the second (""Cambridge"") and the third (""English"").

During the first World War, Piston enlisted with the Navy band as a saxophonist. Afterward, he seems to have had a more focused interest in music, studying at Harvard University under the tutelage of Archibald D. Davison. He was graduated summa cum laude in 1924, the eldest graduate in his class by some nine years. After two years of profitable instruction in France with Nadia Boulanger and Paul Dukas, Piston returned to Boston and accepted a spot on the faculty at his alma mater, a position he kept until 1960. His students over the years included Leonard Bernstein, Elliot Carter, and Harold Shapero. He enjoyed a fabulous relationship with several American orchestras, most notably the Boston Symphony under Serge Koussevitsky (every American composer’s ""best friend""), Charles Munch, and Erich Leinsdorf, and he received many honors throughout his life, including two Pulitzer Prizes (for his Third and Seventh Symphonies). His most popular work remains his only ballet score, The Incredible Flutist, written in 1938 for Arthur Fiedler and Hans Wiener. In addition to his music, Walter Piston wrote several valuable textbooks: Harmony, Principles of Harmonic Analysis, Counterpoint, and Orchestration, which remain in use today. His wife of more than fifty years, the painter Kathryn Nason (whom he met at Harvard in 1920), died in February 1976. Their marriage seems to have been happy, although childless, and Walter Piston died later that year on November 12, shortly after completing his enigmatic yet profound last work, the Concerto for String Quartet, Winds, and Percussion.",,

However, his music speaks for himself. He was a genious (very much respected by Sibelius) but never won recognition. The reason why he was neglected remains in the fact that his music was too modern for the Finnish audiences of his time. Many of his works were never performed during his lifetime (only one of his orchestral works was pulbished!) and he has been rediscovered by musicologists as late as in the 1990s. The Väinö Raitio Society was founded in 1991.",,

After early public appearances as a pianist and composer, he studied at the Akademie der Tonkunst in Munich and then was active as opera kapellmeister an chorus director in Aussig. Later he returned to the city of the Meistersinger as a freelance composer. Already in his youth he felt that music was born deep inside humanity, without any models in the external world. By meditation new worlds opened up inside him. The insight to be gained in this way allows human and musical evolution to be seen in an entirely new light, because they lead into the depths of the human being and of nature. Indeed his symphonies depend on an art attained through ‘soul techniques’ based on meditation. Not without reason did his contemporaries speak of the inner strength and warmth that lives in this Nuremberg composer’s symphonic music. 1970 Martin Scherber was hit by a drunken driver and died in early 1974 from the consequences of the accident.

He settled in Rome, and soon grew famous as a pianist. He played Beethoven, Schumann and Chopin, and did much to introduce their works into Italy. In 1866 he formed an orchesta in Rome and conducted the first Italian perfomances of Beethoven´s Eroica Symphony and Liszt´s Dante Symphony. He also introduced Beethoven´s Emperor Concerto, playing the solo part himself. He planned a trip to Germany, but when Liszt came to Rome he remained there to study under that great master. At this time his earlier compositions, mostly chamber works, brought him into notice in a new field. These quartets and quintets were followed by a festival overture, a piano concerto, and symphonies in succession.  In 1876 he founded the Liceo of Roma and conducted the quintet of Queen Margarita. His compositions are somewhat lacking in spontaneity, but they display great learning, and undeniable skill. His works show the influence of Liszt and Berlioz, mingles with the stricter style of the old Italian contrapuntal writers.",,

In 1907 Robert Stolz became conductor at the Theater an der Wien, where he conducted leading operettas of his time, but his first great success came with the publication of his song ""Servus du!"" in 1911, which was followed by many other popular songs. In 1940 he went to the USA where he composed music for Hollywood films. His film scores were twice nominated for Academy Awards.

4455,Carlo,Taube,,,"Galizien,now Poland","Auschwitz,Poland","Carlo Taube was a virtuoso pianist. He studied with Busoni in Vienna for some time. He played in cafes and night clubs, first in Vienna and later in Brno and Prague, to earn a living. With his wife Erika and their child, he arrived at Terezín in December, 1941. There Taube led concerts of semi-classical music, very much in the style of the ""spa"" orchestras popular in pre-war Europe, in the musical pavilion in the neglected park on the Terezín square. He also gave ambitious piano concerts, probably overly-ambitious, according to some critics in the crowd. Taube composed a number of works in Terezin, but only one survives, the song “Ein Jüdisches Kind”, composed on 4 November 1942, set to a text by his wife, Erika. This short but moving work has some Hebraic elements in its melodic writing, while its simple but effective harmonies are reminiscent of what may have been Taube’s piano style in the clubs. Both the poem and music are a touching tribute to their own Jewish child, who accompanied his parents to Auschwitz in October 1944, where they perished. <span style=""float: right;"">[Source: <a href=""http://http://www.leonarda.com/program-notes/note342.html"">http://www.leonarda.com/program-notes/note342.html]",,

4800,Adolf,von Henselt,1814-05-09,,"Schwabach,Germany","Cieplice,Czech Republic","Adolf von Henselt was born in 1814 in Schwabach, a small village close to Nuremberg,as one of six children, and at the age of 3 moved to Munich where hehad his first piano lessons beeing five years old. At the age of fifteen he gave his first public recital, and in 1831 was granted a stipend to study piano with Hummel and composition in Vienna with Simon Sechter. Aristrocatic in looks and bearing, he would in later years resemble the Emperor Franz Josef. His early success touring in Germany and Russia was undelined by the reception of his sets of studies (op. 2 &amp; 5). They were dedicated to his royal patron and included the best (only?) known work of Henselt today - &quot;Si oiseau j’étai, à toi volerai&quot;, a tricky feather-light study in sixths once given the distinction of a recording by Rachmaninov. These Studies attracted a lot of attention for the young virtuoso, many of them presenting technical problems different from those in Chopin’s two sets (published previously) but still maintaining the new concept of exercises wraped in poetry.To the present day they remain beyond the capabilities of many pianists. Even the legendary Anton Rubinstein had to admit defeat. After working on the Etudes and the F minor Piano Concerto for a few days, he realised ""it was a waste of time, for they were based on an abnormal formation of the hand. In this respect, Henselt, like Paganini was a freak&quot;. There is a liberal use of chords of the tenth (sometimes twelth) and arpeggios with a larger strecht than an octave. It wasn’t that Henselt had large hands - au contraire, he is known to have small hands with short fleshy fingers. But by means of diligent self-consuming practice he managed to achieve an amazing degree of elasticity with an extension that could reach C-E-G-C-F in his left hand and B-E-A-C-E in the right!! All this augured well for an important career as a pianist and composer. Neither came about. Towards the end of his life Henselt himself recognised that he had not fullfilled his early promise. As a composer, he simply has nothing else to say after the age of thirty, recognised the fact and lived with it. From the completion of the F minor Concerto (1844) to his death, there is no advance in style or content in the few works. Given the paucity of creativity, the extent of his influence on piano playing is remarkable, for two reasons. First by way of the prodigious technical invention of the Études (and for that matter, the Concerto), resulted in fuller tone in bass and greatly increased coverage in the upper registers of the keyboard. This his to be seen in the later music of Balakirev, Lyapunov, Scriabin and Rachmaninov (who must have greatly benefied from his study of Henselt). The second influence Henselt had on the piano playing was a result of his position in the cultural life of Russia. His triumph as a visiting concert pianist in St. Petersburg in 1838 led immediately to him being named Court Pianist. From then until his death, Henselt spent all but the summer months each year in the Russian city where he enjoyed a princely lifestyle and was on intimate terms with three successive Tsars. And this does not take into acount tje influence of Henselt’s own private pupils. Among them were Rachmaninov’s grandfather and Nicolai Zverev. Zverev taught Rachmaninov himself, Lhevinne, Siloti ans Scriabin. Here we have the foundations of the present Russian school of piano-playing with its emphasis on singing melody and freedom of hand movement. Henselt’s contribution to the piano was at least as significant as that of Liszt and Leschetizky.",,

After graduation in 1943 he spent one year teaching at Colby Junior College in New Hampshire before embarking on a 16 year stint at the Woman’s College, University of North Carolina, Greensboro. In 1960 he left that position to become a member of the newly-formed music faculty at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada. This decision proved to be a watershed in his development as a composer because it was on the west coast that he was to come face to face with the Asian cultures with which he had long been fascinated. This led him into a deep study particularly of, but not limited to, the music of Japan. During the course of the next two decades he spent several months of each year in Japan and  became a master in the prestigious Kinko school of shakuhachi (vertical bamboo flute) playing. His continuing work at UBC partly involved the inception of  the vibrant ethnomusicology program now offered by the School of Music. He retired from his professorship in 1984 and began an exciting time of travel, writing and composition which continued until his death from congestive heart failure at the end of 2001. His last work was completed in his final year and given its first performance six weeks before his death at the age of 82.",,

In 1942-45 he received artistic guidance from George Enescu. On December 6, 1944, Stanisław Wisłocki organised a special concert of the Romanian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the proceeds of which he allocated for the reconstruction of Warsaw. It was one of the first such concerts of the world. After six years abroad as a refugee, he returned to Poland to organise, in 1945, the Polish Chamber Orchestra, made up of pre-war musicians of the Warsaw Philharmonic. Two years later he founded the Poznañ Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra and remained its music director and first conductor for 11 years. Simultaneously he conducted at numerous concerts at home and abroad, which everywhere received laudatory reviews. For two years he collaborated with Grzegorz Fitelberg in directing the Polish Radio National Symphony Orchestra in Katowice. Since 1961 he was conductor of the National Philharmonic, then in 1978-1982 general and music director of the Polish Radio and TV National Symphony Orchestra, with which he made many records and archive recordings for the radio. He received many prestigious record awards, including Grand Prix du Disque for Rachmaninov’s Piano Concerto No.2 with Sviatoslav Richter and the National Philharmonic Orchestra on Deutsche Grammophon. He was conducted the most eminent European and American orchestras and given concerts with well-known soloists, such as Argerich, Arrau, Askenase, Berman, Boulanger, Cattel, Drzewiecki, Ekier, Fischer, Forrester, Francescatti, Gitlis, Grychto³ówna, Indjic, Janowski, Kêdra, Kulka, Magaloff, Magin, Malcucyñski, Menuhin, Paleczny, Pergamenshikov, Ricci, Richter, Rubinstein, Stern, Szeryng, Szpinalski, Sztompka, Totenberg, Umiñska, Weissenberg, Wilkomirska, Wroñski etc. Stanisław Wisłocki has founded many music festivals, including a Bach and Mozart festival. In Poznañ in 1979 he organised a festival of the Polish Radio and TV National Symphony Orchestra, entitled &quot;Beethoven Our Contemporary&quot;, which included performances of all the composer’s symphonies in five days (!). In 1980 he organised a festival devoted to Brahms music, an in following year he staged Karol Szymanowski opera &quot;King Roger&quot; with a cast of Polish soloists for Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires. He was also music director of the Teatro Colon Philharmonic Orchestra. Since 1948 till closing of the school in 1951 Wisłocki taught in the State Higher Opera School in Poznañ. Subsequently he took over the conducting class in the State Higher School of Music in Poznañ, previously taught by Walerian Bierdiajew. Since 1955 he has been Professor of Warsaw’s Higher School of Music, which was later to become the Music Academy in Warsaw. Since 1958 he has been head of the Conducting Faculty in that Academy. In the course of numerous music tours on all the continents, Wisłocki has gained a reputation as an excellent conductor who tirelessly propagates Polish culture abroad by including works by Polish composers in the programmes of the majority of his concerts an in the repertoire of the orchestras he has conducted. Any appreciation of Stanisław Wisłocki’s conducting art must emphasise his outstanding knowledge of, and feeling for the music, his unique gift of interpretation, his splendid technique and sense of proportion in the live creation of musical works. Another important feature of Wisłocki’s performing finesse is his great respect for the composers intentions recorded in their scores, which does not diminish the individuality of his conducting in any way.",,

After a period at the Paris Conservatoire he returned to Shanghai in 1935; he subsequently worked for the Pathé (Baidai) Record Company, headed the music section of the left-wing New China (Xinhua) Film Company, and composed many songs for use in anti-Japanese popular movements. With the outbreak of war with Japan in 1937, Xian moved to Wuhan then to the Communist headquarters at Yan’an, where he became head of music at Lu Xun College of the Arts (1938), composed several significant nationalistic compositions, such as the cantata Huanghe (1939), and encouraged the study of folk music so that it could be better adapted by reformist composers. In 1940 he moved to Moscow for further study, and remained in various parts of the Soviet Union and Mongolia until his death. As with his contemporary Nie Er, Xian’s image was held up after his death by the Communist Party as that of a model revolutionary musician: his present reputation in Chinese musical circles stems more from politically motivated discussions of his life and personality than from the impact of specific compositions.",,

Active as a man of letters, artist and musician, he was an equally accomplished explorer, sportsman, hunter and soldier. Perhaps the only thing Harant lacked was property.
